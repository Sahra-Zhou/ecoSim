<h1>The Story Behind Wolf and Sheep Combination</h1>
<h2>The Elimination and Restoration of Wolf</h2>
<p>
    Sheep, that&#x2019s been kept domestically for thousands of years, is a valuable livestock for human. People have dedicated a lot to protect these animals. However, in the 1800s, settlers came across with an issue as a result of westward expansion: native predators who prey on their livestock. This conflict eventually led to the elimination of wolves. 
</p>
<p>
    From late 1800s to early 1900s, predators, involving wolves, are killed in Yellowstone, resulting in a total disaster. In the 70 years of the wolves&#x2019 absence, the Yellowstone&#x2019s ecosystem fell out of balance. Smaller predators&#x2019 and elks&#x2019 population exploded, causing small creatures, such as songbird and beavers, unable to feed themselves. Then, had people realized the important role wolves played in the ecosystem and the necessity of restoration. 1975, the long process to restore wolves in Yellowstone began. The reintroduction began in 1995. However, many factors, like human harvest, prey densities and abundance of other predators, impact its effect. Although people had worried about the reintroduction may harm current elk and deer population, it&#x2019s been proved now that reintroduced wolves helped stabilize the ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
    This is a profound lesson about the heavy price human may pay for attempting to eliminate certain species from the ecosystem. Similar voices have never disappeared. The thought of eliminating mosquitoes is brought up from time to time. Nowadays, predicting species loss in complex ecosystem is still a great challenge. Even though some species have always been headaches, people should also be prudent when they attempt to dramatically reducing a species&#x2019 population, as the consequences could be too painful to bear.

    In this simulator, I wish players could explore different combinations of wolves and sheep population and have a deeper understanding of the consequence of the absence of predators.
