    <h1>Ecosystem Simulator</h1>

    <h1>About this simulator</h1>
<h2>What can you do?</h2>
<p>You can choose upto four species to place in an environment. Determining their population at the beginning and observe how their populations change. During the game, you can also add or remove species. The game ends once all creatures die.</p>

<h2>How is this different from other predator-prey ecosystems?</h2>
<p>First, in this simulator, your choices are not limited to one predator-prey pair in the ecosystem. 
    You are free choose whatever species you'd like to place. 
    However, there are some rules between different species and some species do not have evident impact on each other. 
    For example, birds' populations have limited impact on sheep. 
    Second, while many other similar models only give updates of populations once the game starts, 
    in this simulator, you can dynamically intervene the ecosystem whenever you want until the game ends.</p>
<h2>Purpose of This Game</h2>
<p>
    The main goal of this game is to allow people to experience the impact of human intervention. 
    During the game, you can increasing or decreasing populations to see if your action will maintain the balance or crash the ecosystem.
</p>
<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>There have been many examples of how human intervention has resulted in irreversible consequences. 
    For example, street cats have become a great threats to local birds.
    With this game, I hope players can experience how easily it is to break the balance in an ecosystem and how hard it is to repair it.
